# lan-play-curses

A simple curses GUI for switch-lan-play (https://github.com/spacemeowx2/switch-lan-play). Written for GNU/Linux but should also work on Windows (I haven't tested it so don't take my word for it)

## Usage

Place your `lan-play client`, `lan-play-curses.py` and `servers.json` in the same directory (or edit the path yourself) and launch the script. Run it as root/admin

```
$ sudo python3 lan-play-curses.py
```
In `servers.json`, the name and pmtu fields are optional. Set a pmtu of 500 to play Animal Crossing. Add/remove servers to your liking by following the template.
